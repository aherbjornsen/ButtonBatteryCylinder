# ButtonBatteryCylinder
This is a remix of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5201315 inspired by the design in https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5322108

It incorporates brodykenrick's text_on_OpenSCAD: https://github.com/brodykenrick/text_on_OpenSCAD

It will create cylindrical cases to store button batteries, and support most existing battery types with a configurable number of batteries.
